# Albert Nikolli – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a place where I share my journey from professional dancer to full-stack web developer. This site showcases the projects I've built for real clients across the arts, wellness, hospitality, and event industries.

## 👋 About Me

I'm **Albert Nikolli**, originally from Albania, raised in Italy, and currently based in Lyon, France. For the past decade, I've performed as a professional dancer across Europe — including at the Opéra de Lyon, Tiroler Landestheater, and Hamburg Youth Ballet.

Alongside my artistic career, I pursued academic studies in economics and marketing, and more recently, transitioned into the world of code. I completed the **Le Wagon bootcamp** in 2024 and have been working as a **freelance web developer** ever since — building real tools for real people.
